# Working of My chatbot in brief!
Warm greetings everyone!!!

Thank you for having a glance at my chatbot....

Coming to the working of my chatbot, it is a basic python chatbot that runs on the terminal. It gives you the details of Earthquakes in the past 10 years i.e; from 2010 to 2020. My chatbot greets user in a polite manner and asks for the details of the details of the user such as name and gender so that it will know that whether user is a male or female and can further reply based on the details given. It asks for a confirmation whether the user is interested to know the details of earthquakes in a particualar or not. If yes it keeps going else it will end with a Thanking message. After proceeding it will be asking for a year to enter between 2010-2020, if we enter another year other than these it gives us a message to recheck the year entered and ends if enter a correct year between 2010-2020, it gives us the details such as toatal number of earthquakes occured across the world in the particular given year, highest magnitude of the earthquake in that year and the place where the highest magnitude of earthquake is recorded in the given year. And it ends with a polite thanking message to the user.

You can get basic information about the earthquakes across the world in the past decade with the help of this chatbot without googling!!!

Once again thank you respected Sir/Madam.
